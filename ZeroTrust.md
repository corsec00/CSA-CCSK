# Zero Trust

### 1 Introduction to Zero Trust Architecture

Q: Which organization first implement Zero Trust for its employees?
A: Google

Q: Google BeyondCorp model and approach initially revolved around which of the following ideas/premisses?
A: Due to expanding permieter, traditional permieter-based security was no longer sufficient to protect against cyber threats

Q: The eraly concept of ZT was based on which of the following models/approaches?
A: A data-centric network design leveraging micro-segmentation

Q: Which of the following is NOT a cause of increased IT Complexity addessed by ZTA?
A: The adoption of IA/ML

Q: Per its model of creating virtual enclaves and granting access to resources inside those enclaves, which of the following best describes the ZT concept?
A: enables de design of architectures from the inside ou, versus outside in. 

### 2 Definitions, Concepts & Components of ZT
Q: A key aspect of ZT network is that
A: Authentication and explicit authorization must occur prior to resource access being granted

Q: According to US Department of Defense (DOD), what are the main tenents of ZT?
A: Assume a hostile environment, assume breach, never trust/always verify, scrutinize explicit, and apply unified analytics 

Q: What are the pilars of ZTA, as specified by US Depto of Defense (DOD)?
A: Users/identities, Device/endpoints, Network/environment, Applications and workload, Data, Visibility and analytics, Automation and orchestration

Q: Which of the following statements is TRUE regarding ZT?
A: Authentication and explicit authorization must occur prior to resource access being granted

Q: Which of the following is not a core component of ZTA?
A: Policy

### 3 Objectives of Zero  Trust
Q: Which of the following is a business objective of a ZTA?
A: Risk Reduction

Q: Which of the following is a technical objective of ZTA?
A: Improve security posture and resilience

Q: ZT improves the security posture and resilience of an organization's IT environment by ensuring that source scanning and mapping activities initioated by internal or external actors:
A: Are only allowed within the ZT implementation by authenticated, authorizated entities

Q: Security approaches and frameworks based on physical objects and systems, as well as signature-based threat detection, are no longer pratical due to the
A: Increased frequency and scale of cyber attacks, virtualized enviorenments, and software-based organizations

Q: Which of the following is NOT a technical objective of organizations looking to implement ZT?
A: Compliance management

### 4 Benefits of Zero Trust

Q: Which of the following describes a ZTA benefit that improves visibility into user activities and related analytics?
A: Granular logging and monitoring

Q: ZTA improves the capacity to restrict lateral movement by hackers through the implementation of with of the following technologies?
A: Micro-segmentation

Q: What ZTA implementation beneficts are realized when leveraging the concept of resource hiding, where resources are only visible to authenticated, authorized user?
A: Reduce attack surface and radius of impact

Q: Which of the following is NOT a ZTA benefit related to visibility and analytics-related improvements?
A: Data masking and obfuscation

Q: Which of the following is not a benefit of ZTA?
A: Increase trustworthhiness in logging and monitoring

### 5 Planning Considerations Zero Trust

Q: Which of the following is a factor to take into consideration when implementing ZTAs approaches and design principles?
A: The complexity of service architecture and data flows

Board and executive-level mandatess regarding the implementation of ZTA
The organizations track records in terms of data breaches and security compromisses
(NO) The maturity level of the organization's IT and security department/personnel

Q: In the event of a PEP or PDP failure in a ZTA, which of the following is the most relevant risk for mitigation
A: Implementation risk of hindering users and affected applications from authentication/operating properly

Q: Which of the following is a main pillar in CISAs ZT Maturity model?
A: Application Workload

Q: Which of the following is NOT a factor to consider when implementing ZTA inb a organization?
A: Trust based approach

Q: Which of the following steps in ZTA organizational and technical planning involves determining the maturity level of the organizations's internal approaches and process?
A: Define current state

### 6 ZTA Implementation Examples

Q: Which of the following specifies the use of an access proxy for all access attempts and comunications?
A: BeyondCorp

Q: Which of the following implementation models relies heavily on single packcet authorization (SPA)?
A: SDP

Q: Which of the following is NOT true of ZTNA
A: It is ideal for protectiong unmanagement devices

Q: SDP maturity level and widespread adoption can be partially attributed to which one of the following?
A: Regular hackathons that test SDP's attack durability continue to add to its popularity

Q: An organization wishes to deploy ZTA in its multiple cloud environment. iot hosts its own local networ model is ideal for this scenario?
A: Service Initiated (cloud-to-cloud)

### 7 ZTA Use cases

Q: Wihch of the following is an improved ZTA mitigation from malicious attackers compared to network micro-segmentation?
A: Lateral movement is limited since devices are hidden from unkown or unauthorized users

Q: Which one of the following ZXTA features inmproves secure remote access when compared to a VPN?
A: 
(NO) Greater scalability and resiliency is achieved through ZT gateways and controllers
(NO) Authentication is required prior to the connection getting established

Q: Which of the following are ZTA features that improve remote users access compare to a vpn?
A: Fine grained security through a ZT gateway for each service or application

Q: Which of the following are true about traditional remote access VPNs but not ZTA?
A: Users can access all organization assets after authentication
